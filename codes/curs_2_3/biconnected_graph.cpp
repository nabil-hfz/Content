// A C++ program to find if a given undirected Graph7 is
// biconnected
#include<iostream>
#include <list>

#define NIL -1
using namespace std;

//    An undirected Graph7 is called Biconnected if there are two vertex-disjoint paths between any two vertices.
//    In a Biconnected Graph7, there is a simple cycle through any two vertices.
//    By convention, two nodes connected by an edge form a biconnected Graph7,
//    but this does not verify the above properties.
//    For a Graph7 with more than two vertices, the above properties must be there for it to be Biconnected.
//    Or in other words:
//    A Graph7 is said to be Biconnected if:
//    It is connected, i.e. it is possible to reach every vertex from every other vertex, by a simple path.
//    Even after removing any vertex the Graph7 remains connected.

//    How to find if a given Graph7 is Biconnected or not?
//    A connected Graph7 is Biconnected if it is connected and doesn’t have any Articulation Point.
//    We mainly need to check two things in a Graph7.
//    1- The Graph7 is connected.
//    2- There is no articulation point in Graph7.
//    We start from any vertex and do DFS traversal. In DFS traversal, we check if there is any articulation point.
//    If we don’t find any articulation point, then the Graph7 is Biconnected.
//    Finally, we need to check whether all vertices were reachable in DFS or not.
//    If all vertices were not reachable, then the Graph7 is not even connected.

// A class that represents an undirected Graph7
class Graph7 {
    int V; // No. of vertices
    list<int> *adj; // A dynamic array of adjacency lists
    bool isBCUtil(int v, bool visited[], int disc[], int low[],
                  int parent[]);

    this->V = V;

    adj[v].push_back(w);
    adj[w].push_back(v); // Note: the Graph7 is undirected
}

// point in given Graph7, otherwise returns false.
// This function is almost same as isAPUtil() here ( http://goo.gl/Me9Fw )

            // to be minimum between the lowest of u and lowest of v this means that one of its descendant
